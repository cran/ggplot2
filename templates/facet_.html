<h1>Facetting</h1>

<p>Facetting (also known as conditioned or trellis plots) allows us to easily create small multiples of different subsets of an entire dataset. This is a powerful tool when investigating whether patterns hold across all conditions.</p>

<p>Currently, there is only one type of facetting available in ggplot: facet_grid.</p>
