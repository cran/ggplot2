<h1>Faceting</h1>

<p>Faceting (also known as conditioned or trellis plots) allows us to easily create small multiples of different subsets of an entire dataset. This is a powerful tool when investigating whether patterns hold across all conditions.</p>

<p>Currently, there is only one type of faceting available in ggplot: facet_grid.</p>
