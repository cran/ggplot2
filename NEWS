ggplot2 0.8.7 (2010-XX-XX) ----------------------------------------

* Fixed bug in stat_density2d when contour = FALSE (Thanks to takahashi kohske) 
* geom_point legend takes more care to ensure that fill colours will be shown
* legend: fixed scale merging bug when labels were set manually
* stat_bin: deals with floating point rounding issues using the same algorithm as base::hist
* fullseq: now always returns vector of length two, even when range is 0
* stat_bin2d: fix typo in breaks calculation
* scale_area: gains a legend argument like all other scales
* scale_colour_brewer: gains na.colour argument to set colour of missing values
* corrected label generation for computed aesthetics (..x..) and special names (`x x`)
* coord_map gains xlim and ylim arguments to control region of projection
