\description{Equal scale cartesian coordinates}
\details{
An equal scale coordinate system plays a similar role to ?eqscplot in MASS, but it works for all types of graphics, not just scatterplots.

This coordinate system has one parameter, \code{ratio}, which specifies the ratio between the x and y scales. An aspect ratio of two means that the plot will be twice as high as wide.  An aspection ratio of 1/2 means that the plot will be twice as wide as high.   By default, the aspect.ratio of the plot will also be set to this value.

This page describes coord\_equal, see \code{\link{layer}} and \code{\link{qplot}} for how to create a complete plot from individual components.

# coord_equal ensures that the ranges of axes are equal to the
# specified ratio (1 by default, indicating equal ranges).

qplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars) + coord_equal(ratio = 1)
qplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars) + coord_equal(ratio = 5)
qplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars) + coord_equal(ratio = 1/5)

# Resize the plot, and you'll see that the specified aspect ratio is 
# mantained
