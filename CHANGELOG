ggplot 0.5.5
----------------------------------------

Improvements:
	* ggplot now gives rather more helpful errors if you have misspecified a variable name in the aesthetic mapping
	* changed default hline and vline intercepts to 0
	* added "count" output variable from stat_density for creating stacked/conditional density plots
	* added parameters to geom_boxplot to control appearance of outlying points
	* overriding aesthetics with fixed values that have already been set with aesthetics now actually works
	* slightly better names for xaxis and yaxis grobs
	* added aes_string function to make it easier to construction aesthetic mapping specifications in functions
	* continuous scales now have labels argument so that you can manually specify labels if desired
	* stat_density now calculates densities on a common grid across groups.  This means that position_fill and position_stack now work properly
	* if numeric, legend labels right aligned
	* polar coordinates much improved, and with better examples

Documentation:
	* fixed argument documentation for qplot
	* added (very) rudimentary documentation about what functions return
	* documentation now lists extra variables created by statistics

Bug fixes:
	* coord_flip now works with segment and all interval geoms
	* geom_errorbar now works in all coordinate systems
	* derived y axes (eg. on histogram) are now labelled correctly
	* fixed bug in stat_quantile caused by new output format from predict.rq
	* fixed bug if x or y are constant
	* fixed bug in histogram where sometimes lowest bar was omitted
	* fixed bug in stat_qq which prevent setting aesthetics
	* fixed bug in qplot(..., geom="density", position="identity")
	* fixed stat_qq so that unnecessary arguments are no longer passed to the distribution function

Subtractions:
	* removed grid argument from ggsave, replaced by ggtheme(theme_bw)
	* removed add argument from qplot


ggplot 0.5.4
----------------------------------------

	* border now drawn on top of geoms, instead of below - this results in better appearance when adjusting scale limits
	* ggplot() + aes() now modifies existing default aesthetic mapping, rather than overwriting
	* polish examples in facet_grid

ggplot 0.5.3
----------------------------------------

	* added experimental scatterplot matrix, see ?plotmatrix
	* added new border.colour and grid.minor.colour options for better control over plot apperance
	* updated theme_bw to do better when drawing a plot with white background 
	* better default colour choices for gradients (and more discussion in examples)
	* fixed bug in ScaleGradient2 where scales with different positive and negative ranges were not scaled correctly
	* allow expressions as result from strip.text
	* fixed rare bug in geom_vline and geom_hline
	* fixed example in geom_abline
	* tweaked display of multiline axis labels

ggplot 0.5.2
----------------------------------------

	* add argument to position dodge so it's now possible to accurately dodge things with different widths to their physical widths 
	* added median summary
	* new examples:
		* logistic regression example in stat_smooth
	* bugs fixed:
		* evaluation of arguments to layer is no longer delayed
		* can use categorical xseq with stat_smooth
		* x and y axes named incorrectly (thanks to Dieter Menne for spotting this)
		* can now pass position objects to qplot
		* y jitter calculated correctly, and jittered data rescales axis now
		* removed silly legend from quantile plot
		* extra arguments not being passed on to geoms/stats
		* fixed bug in stat_summary when summarising a factor
		* fixed bugs in stat_summary, geom_ribbon, and coord_trans examples

ggplot 0.5.1
----------------------------------------

	* renamed scale_manual to scale_identity to map position_identity and stat_identity
	* ensured all grob consistently named
	* renamed aesthetics argument to mapping to be consistent with description in book
	* added useful utilities for modifying grobs
	* bug fixes to x axis range with interval geoms
	* added ability to turn legend off for single scale (currently undocumented)
	* added economics data set and matching examples

ggplot2 0.5
----------------------------------------

 * complete rewrite of ggplot code base

 * id/grouping completely rewritten so that automatically grouped when any of the aesthetics is a categorical variable.  This behaviour is defined in the Grammar of Graphics, and makes things like qplot(wt, data=mtcars, geom="density", colour=factor(cyl)) work nicely
